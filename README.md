# ⚙️ Hand-on! ⚙️

Let's start with VS Code, the text editor that we will use to make changes to our project.

## ⚔️ VS Code Setup

To help us with the code, we will use the VS Code editor!


## 📍 Git

Now. let's understand Git, a version control tool to let us work together at the same time without conflits!

## 🥋 Next.js / React

To create a new React project, we will use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest 
```
This creates a new project with the latest version of Next.js. 

```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will start the development server at http://localhost:3000 and it will show any change in the code in real-time!
